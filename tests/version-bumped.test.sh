# version-bumped.test.sh -- the "Version bumped" gate, in BOTH workflows that
# embed it: .github/workflows/ci.yml AND .github/workflows/self-hosted-ci.yml
# (bdh-org/dev-common#124, #180, #182; bdh-org/home-infra#617).
#
# IT RUNS EVERY CASE AGAINST BOTH FILES, and that is the whole point of the
# rewrite. This file used to hardcode ci.yml. #182 then tightened the comparison
# from "differs" to "strictly greater" in ci.yml ONLY, and this suite went green
# for ten days while every repo in the stack -- all of which call
# self-hosted-ci.yml@main -- ran the weaker test. The fix looked shipped and had
# reached nothing.
#
# The gate's own comment in self-hosted-ci.yml already said "It has to be in
# BOTH", citing an earlier incident that made the same argument. So the class had
# been learned, written down at the exact site, and repeated anyway six weeks
# later. A comment cannot enforce agreement between two files; a test can, and
# refusing to hardcode one of the two is the enforcement.
#
# The gate used to ask whether VERSION *differed* from the base branch's. That
# passes every branch in a parallel set: on 2026-08-14 three panoptikon PRs each
# branched from 2.12.105 and each ran `make bump-patch` to 2.12.106. All three
# differed from their base, all three went green, all three merged. The first
# took the 2.12.106 tag; the other two rode onto main under a version whose tag
# pointed two commits behind them, and `tag-version.yml` never fired again
# because VERSION had not changed. Nothing was red at any point.
#
# So the gate now asks for STRICTLY GREATER. That catches the second and third
# PR -- but only when their CI re-runs against the moved base, which is what
# "Require branches to be up to date before merging" enforces at the branch
# settings. That rollout is recorded in bdh-org/home-infra#414's comments and
# tracked for drift by #623. This file tests the half that lives in code; the
# other half is a repo setting and cannot be tested here -- and, since the
# branch-protection API 403s for the bdh-ai account, cannot currently be
# OBSERVED from here either, which is #623's problem rather than this file's.
#
# The cases run the REAL step body, extracted from the workflow, against
# throwaway git repos -- not a re-implementation of its logic, which would pass
# while the workflow shipped something else.
#
# Usage:  bash tests/version-bumped.test.sh      (or: make test)
