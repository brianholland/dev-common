#!/usr/bin/env bash
# tag-version-collision.test.sh -- the "Check if tag exists" step in BOTH tagging
# workflows: .github/workflows/tag-version.yml and tag-version-self-hosted.yml.
# bdh-org/home-infra#617.
#
# RUNS EVERY CASE AGAINST BOTH FILES, deliberately. The sibling suite
# version-bumped.test.sh used to hardcode ci.yml, and that is exactly how
# dev-common#182's fix reached one workflow and not the other while the suite stayed
# green for ten days -- every repo in the stack runs the file that was missed. Two
# copies of a step need one test that refuses to pick a favourite.
#
# WHY THESE CASES
#
# The step used to answer a yes/no question -- does this tag exist? -- and skip when
# the answer was yes. But "exists" covers two situations that need OPPOSITE responses:
#
#   same commit      -> benign. A re-run. Skipping is correct.
#   DIFFERENT commit -> this tree is on main under a version belonging to another
#                       tree. Ten commits across slingshot and panoptikon are
#                       permanently in that state, and nothing ever went red.
#
# So the load-bearing case is #3. The rest exist to stop the fix over-firing, which
# would be worse than the bug: a tagging step that fails on a re-run blocks releases.
#
# The cases run the REAL step body, extracted from each workflow, against throwaway
# git repos -- not a re-implementation, which would pass while the workflow shipped
# something else.
