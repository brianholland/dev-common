# Devcontainer Scripts

Composable scripts for setting up development containers. Projects source these scripts rather than using a monolithic template.

## Quick Start

Create `.devcontainer/setup.sh` in your project:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Path to dev-common (adjust based on your submodule location)
COMMON="/workspaces/${PWD##*/}/common/devcontainer"

# Core setup: tmux, Miniforge, shell aliases
source "$COMMON/setup-base.sh"

# Python dev tools + project packages
source "$COMMON/setup-python-dev.sh" "conda-packages.txt"

# Claude Code CLI (native installer)
source "$COMMON/setup-claude.sh"

# Grok Build CLI (xAI's coding agent)
source "$COMMON/setup-grok.sh"
```

## Scripts

### setup-base.sh

Core setup sourced by all projects:

- Installs tmux
- Removes `/opt/conda` if present
- Installs Miniforge to `~/miniforge3`
- Configures `.condarc` with conda-forge (strict channel priority)
- Adds shell aliases (`gl`, `l`, `la`, `ll`)
- Sets PATH priority (conda before `~/.local/bin`)
- Applies the global git hygiene config via `git-hygiene.sh`

### git-hygiene.sh

Single source of truth for the global git config the setup scripts own —
`fetch.prune` and the `git gone` alias. Run as a standalone script (not
sourced) by both `setup-base.sh` (container) and `init-host.sh` (host), so
the two can't drift apart.

```bash
bash "$COMMON/git-hygiene.sh"           # apply (idempotent)
bash "$COMMON/git-hygiene.sh" --check   # report drift, change nothing, exit 1 if drifted
```

`git gone` deletes local branches whose upstream was merged and deleted on
the remote. It **refuses to prune** — loudly, with a non-zero exit — when
`git fetch -p` fails or the repo has no remote, rather than reporting success
having done nothing from stale upstream state.

Because `init-host.sh` only runs on a devcontainer rebuild, a machine set up
before a config landed never receives it. `make setup-verify` / `make
setup-fix` (see below) are the doctor for that; both work on the host and
inside the container.

### setup-python-dev.sh

Python development tools:

- Installs base packages from `base-conda-packages.txt`
- Optionally installs project-specific packages (pass file path as argument)
- Installs dev tools: ruff, pytest, pytest-cov, ipykernel, jupyterlab, pipreqs

Usage:
```bash
source "$COMMON/setup-python-dev.sh"                      # base packages only
source "$COMMON/setup-python-dev.sh" "conda-packages.txt" # with project packages
```

### setup-claude.sh

Claude Code CLI setup:

- Installs Claude Code CLI via native installer (curl)
- Seeds a private `~/.claude.json` (onboarding stub) if absent, so each
  container keeps its own Claude Code state instead of sharing the host file

### setup-grok.sh

Grok Build CLI setup (xAI's coding agent, command `grok`):

- Installs it with `npm install -g --prefix "$HOME/.local"`, so it lands in
  `~/.local/bin` — already on PATH from `setup-base.sh` — rather than in
  whichever global prefix the first `npm` on PATH happens to own
- Appends a marker-guarded `~/.bashrc` block exporting `XAI_API_KEY` from the
  mounted `~/.config/ai/xai/xai.json`, unless the environment already carries
  one. `${localEnv:XAI_API_KEY}` in `remoteEnv` is empty unless the host
  exports it, so the file is the credential that actually exists
- Runs `grok --version` and reports which credential the container will use,
  naming the miss when there is none

`GROK_INSTALL` selects the route: `npm` (default), `curl` for xAI's shell
installer where npm is absent, or `skip`. npm is the default because it needs
no access to `x.ai`, does not append to `~/.bashrc` behind us, and does not put
a binary named `agent` on PATH — the shell installer does both of those.

**`~/.grok` is container-local, on purpose.** Bind-mounting one state tree into
every container is what corrupted `~/.claude.json`, and this one also holds a
~166 MB binary and the session logs. The credential is the API key instead,
which is xAI's documented path for headless environments. If a *valid* key
still leaves the CLI reporting `Not signed in`, that decision is the thing to
revisit — persist `~/.grok/auth.json` from one `grok login --device-auth`
rather than repeating that login per container (bdh-org/dev-common#236).

The export lands in `~/.bashrc`, so it reaches interactive shells — the same
place PATH is set. A non-interactive script that needs the key should read
`~/.config/ai/xai/xai.json` itself.

Gated by `tests/setup-grok.test.sh` on every PR; run `make test` before
changing it.

### setup-claude-identity.sh

Points `~/.gitconfig` and `~/.config/gh` at the host-managed identity tree
(`~/.config/ai/claude/identity/`), bootstrapping it on a fresh host:

- Symlinks the standard tool paths into that tree, so git and gh find Claude's
  config without environment-variable indirection
- Adds one `include.path = ~/.gitconfig-role` to the identity gitconfig and
  writes that container-local file with `user.name = bdh-ai (<role>)`, derived
  from `$PROJECT_NAME` — `architect` for home-infra, `contractor/<repo>`
  elsewhere. Only `user.name`; `user.email` stays `bdh-ai` everywhere
  (bdh-org/home-infra#317)

Its only inputs are `$HOME` and `$PROJECT_NAME`. Because it runs in every
devcontainer and writes to a gitconfig shared by all of them, it is gated by
`tests/setup-claude-identity.test.sh` on every PR — run it with `make test`
before changing this script (bdh-org/dev-common#157).

## Package Files

### base-conda-packages.txt

Minimal packages installed for all projects:
- python=3.13, pip
- loguru, pandas, numpy, requests, pyyaml

### Project conda-packages.txt

Each project maintains its own `conda-packages.txt` with project-specific dependencies. Pass this to `setup-python-dev.sh`.

## Example devcontainer.json

```json
{
  "name": "My Project",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python:3.12",
  "updateRemoteUserUID": true,
  "features": {
    "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {}
  },
  "initializeCommand": "bash .devcontainer/init-host.sh",
  "runArgs": [
    "--name=dc-my-project"
  ],
  "mounts": [
    "source=${localEnv:HOME}/.claude,target=/home/vscode/.claude,type=bind,consistency=cached",
    "source=${localEnv:HOME}/.config/ai/claude,target=/home/vscode/.config/ai/claude,type=bind,consistency=cached",
    "source=${localEnv:HOME}/.config/ai/xai,target=/home/vscode/.config/ai/xai,type=bind,consistency=cached"
  ],
  "remoteEnv": {
    "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "${localEnv:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}",
    "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${localEnv:GITHUB_TOKEN}"
  },
  "postCreateCommand": "bash .devcontainer/setup.sh",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "settings": {
        "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/home/vscode/miniforge3/bin/python"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Make Targets

The setup scripts handle initial container creation. For ongoing environment management, use the Make targets from `make/python.mk`:

### Environment Management

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make env` | Install/refresh base conda packages, project packages, and dev tools |
| `make env-info` | Show conda environment info and installed packages |

### Setup Doctor

From `make/devcontainer.mk`. Re-asserts the global git config the setup
scripts install, without a devcontainer rebuild. Safe to run on the host.

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make setup-verify` | Report drift in the global git hygiene config; exit 1 if drifted |
| `make setup-fix` | (Re)assert it |

### Production Requirements

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make requirements` | Generate pinned `requirements-prod.txt` for production pip install |
| `make list-imports` | List imports (unpinned, stdout only) |

Configure in your Makefile:
```makefile
COMMON_DIR = common                          # path to dev-common submodule
PROJECT_CONDA_PACKAGES = conda-packages.txt  # project-specific packages (optional)

include common/make/python.mk
```

`make requirements` scans your code with pipreqs to find actual imports (excluding dev tools like ruff, pytest), then pins each package to the version installed in the conda env. The output file is ready for `pip install -r requirements-prod.txt` in a production Dockerfile.

## Design Principles

1. **Composable** - Source individual scripts as needed
2. **Miniforge for conda** - Replaces /opt/conda, uses conda-forge, lighter than Anaconda
3. **Base env only** - The devcontainer is the isolation boundary; no named conda environments needed
4. **Production uses pip** - Multi-stage Docker builds with requirements-prod.txt for small images
5. **pipreqs for imports** - Use `make requirements` to generate pinned production requirements
